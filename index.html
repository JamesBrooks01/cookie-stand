      <p>One day in 2022, Pat was taking his weekly trip to Pike Place Market in Seattle and while doing his shopping, suddenly he stopped in his tracks. He had suddenly thought of the best idea of his life. He thought about a way to create the ultimate Seattle treat. Cookies in the shape of Salmon! It was genius, but Pat knew that he would need help to make his dream come alive so he enlisted the help of his family(pictured right) to assist in the starting of his new business. His wife helps out with the business side of things and his kids help out by frosting the cookies and inventing new designs for the cookies while Pat makes all the cookies. But the one thing that Pat didn't anticipate was how popular his Salmon cookies would be and rapidly he began to see the potenial in making this a full business and so with the profit he had acumulated from the home-ran business, He opened up his first store location in Seattle. Then from there, the business has expanded globally to 5 locations around the world with more places being considered daily as it seems no one in the world can get enough of Pat's Salmon Cookies.</p>
        <p>All Stores Open 6am-8pm Everyday.</p>
